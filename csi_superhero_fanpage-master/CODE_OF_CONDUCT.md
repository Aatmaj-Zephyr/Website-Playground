# Code of Conduct

## When Something Happens

If you see a Code of Conduct violation, follow these steps:

1. Let the person know that what they did is not appropriate and ask them to stop and/or edit their message(s) or commits.
2. That person should immediately stop the behavior and correct the issue.
3. If this doesnâ€™t happen, or if you're uncomfortable speaking up, [contact the maintainers](#contacting-maintainers).
4. As soon as available, a maintainer will look into the issue, and take [further action (see below)](#further-enforcement), starting with a warning, then temporary block, then long-term repo or organization ban.

When reporting, please include any relevant details, links, screenshots, context, or other information that may be used to better understand and resolve the situation.

**The maintainer team will prioritize the well-being and comfort of the recipients of the violation over the comfort of the violator.** 

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers of this project pledge to making participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, technical preferences, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

  * Using welcoming and inclusive language.
  * Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
  * Gracefully accepting constructive feedback.
  * Focusing on what is best for the community.
  * Showing empathy and kindness towards other community members.
  * Encouraging and raising up your peers in the project so you can all bask in hacks and glory.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

  * The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances, including when simulated online. The only exception to sexual topics is channels/spaces specifically for topics of sexual identity.
  * Casual mention of slavery or indentured servitude and/or false comparisons of one's occupation or situation to slavery. Please consider using or asking about alternate terminology when referring to such metaphors in technology.
  * Making light of/making mocking comments about trigger warnings and content warnings.
  * Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
  * Public or private harassment, deliberate intimidation, or threats.
  * Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission. This includes any sort of "outing" of any aspect of someone's identity without their consent.
  * Publishing private screenshots or quotes of interactions in the context of this project without all quoted users' *explicit* consent.
  * Publishing of private communication that doesn't have to do with reporting harrassment.
  * Any of the above even when [presented as "ironic" or "joking"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hipster_racism).
  * Any attempt to present "reverse-ism" versions of the above as violations. Examples of reverse-isms are "reverse racism", "reverse sexism", "heterophobia", and "cisphobia".
  * Unsolicited explanations under the assumption that someone doesn't already know it. Ask before you teach! Don't assume what people's knowledge gaps are.
  * [Feigning or exaggerating surprise](https://www.recurse.com/manual#no-feigned-surprise) when someone admits to not knowing something.
  * "[Well-actuallies](https://www.recurse.com/manual#no-well-actuallys)"
  * Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional or community setting.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within spaces involving this project and in other spaces involving community members. This includes the repository, its Pull Requests and Issue tracker, its Twitter community, private email communications in the context of the project, and any events where members of the project are participating, as well as adjacent communities and venues affecting the project's members.

Depending on the violation, the maintainers may decide that violations of this code of conduct that have happened outside of the scope of the community may deem an individual unwelcome, and take appropriate action to maintain the comfort and safety of its members.

### Other Community Standards

As a project on GitHub, this project is additionally covered by the [GitHub Community Guidelines](https://help.github.com/articles/github-community-guidelines/).
Enforcement of those guidelines after violations overlapping with the above are the responsibility of the entities, and enforcement may happen in any or all of the services/communities.

## Maintainer Enforcement Process

Once the maintainers get involved, they will follow a documented series of steps and do their best to preserve the well-being of project members. This section covers actual concrete steps.

### Contacting Maintainers

You may get in touch with the maintainer team through any of the following methods:

  * Through email:
    * [csi-kjsce@somaiya.edu](mailto:csi-kjsce@somaiya.edu) (CSI team)
    * [@KrutikaBhatt](krutika.bhatt@somaiya.edu) (Krutika Bhatt)

### Further Enforcement

If you've already followed the [initial enforcement steps](#enforcement), these are the steps maintainers will take for further enforcement, as needed:

  1. Repeat the request to stop.
  2. If the person doubles down, they will have offending messages removed or edited by a maintainers given an official warning. The PR or Issue may be locked.
  3. If the behavior continues or is repeated later, the person will be blocked from participating for 24 hours.
  4. If the behavior continues or is repeated after the temporary block, a long-term (6-12mo) ban will be used.

On top of this, maintainers may remove any offending messages, images, contributions, etc, as they deem necessary.

Maintainers reserve full rights to skip any of these steps, at their discretion, if the violation is considered to be a serious and/or immediate threat to the health and well-being of members of the community. These include any threats, serious physical or verbal attacks, and other such behavior that would be completely unacceptable in any social setting that puts our members at risk.

Members expelled from events or venues with any sort of paid attendance will not be refunded.

### Who Watches the Watchers?

Maintainers and other leaders who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership. These may include anything from removal from the maintainer team to a permanent ban from the community.

Additionally, as a project hosted on both GitHub and npm, [their own Codes of Conducts may be applied against maintainers of this project](#other-community-standards), externally of this project's procedures.
